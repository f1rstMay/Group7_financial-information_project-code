The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.

That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.

According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. Itâ€™s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.

Ride comfort & aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but thereâ€™s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%.

Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob wonâ€™t offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value.

Sigh. This is crux of matter: canâ€™t make system too annoying or people wonâ€™t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also canâ€™t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.

Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. Itâ€™s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust â€?literally bulletproof.

I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) & other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America.

Weâ€™ve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union & Tesla stock. Also, free drinks & snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla & me via 3rd parties.

Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.

Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack.

Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling & driving feel. Extremely important metric.

Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear & still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.

When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as theyâ€™re just â€œpassiveâ€?managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!

Lot on our plate, so itâ€™s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler & produce sooner or do all & produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.

~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.

Rocket booster temperatures wonâ€™t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.

Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.

Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isnâ€™t critical for snowy regions.

Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but thatâ€™s a lot of complexity.

This causes some media confusion, as batch builds & ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month & terrible following month, but consumer tastes donâ€™t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.

You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump & combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.

Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability >> human.

Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr & have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla wonâ€™t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.

Very much so. There are 2.5B cars & trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but thatâ€™s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -> demand >> supply.

As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost & larger range pack needed.

Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly & at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move & increases moment of inertia.

Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density & thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp & up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.

Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph. TBC loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. Thatâ€™s 57,600/hour/lane & you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput & convenience.

~1000, as all seats would be â€œcoachâ€?& no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. Itâ€™s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.

FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.

Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you canâ€™t make enough of them & we wonâ€™t be able to.

Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff â€?17

Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.

Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you havenâ€™t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, youâ€™ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, youâ€™re prob ok.

Failure rate is actually both higher & lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.

The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.

There arenâ€™t really meant to be â€œTesla incentivesâ€? just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.

At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.

With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They donâ€™t stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great.

Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.

Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, thereâ€™s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 & 1/4 mile races.

Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called â€œLow Gearâ€?

Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days & requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours & ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.

They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! Itâ€™s pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars.

Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.

Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!

It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Donâ€™t want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain & motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo.

First, we need to make it super safe & easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production & implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.

That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because itâ€™s built inside a factory in volume.

Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.

No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, itâ€™s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles.

Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses & other colds in general population is very high!

Do you have data on the false positive rate? Iâ€™ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and â€œpresumed positiveâ€? https://cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.htmlâ€?51

Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases & using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.

Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe & should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.

Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 & 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.

We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights.

Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.

Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.

Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas thatâ€™s already mixed.

Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner â€œstiffnessâ€? essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.

Somethingâ€™s messed up about medicine thatâ€™s anti-science. In science, you question everyone, no matter who they are. Facts & reasoning are everything, but in medicine too much emphasis is on credentials, often by people whoâ€™ve accomplished nothing but a PhD thesis used by no one.

Not actually a payout, just a vesting of stock options. It may never pay out, as the stock canâ€™t be sold for 5 years after exercise. The stock must be bought & income taxes paid, then hold value for 5 years.

Itâ€™s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant & pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers & stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!

Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we donâ€™t need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.

Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. Thatâ€™s probably faster.

Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day.

Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust.

Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldnâ€™t blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval.

Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low & symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells

People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions & a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect.

The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC & differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever.

No, but you make some great points. Important to note that ironâ€™s cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem.

For Dojo, weâ€™re betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 & existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.

There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.

Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation. 

Itâ€™s already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.

Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people & cargo around Earth (also to moon & Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. Itâ€™s just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.

As soon as we complete testing & regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules & languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long & challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9â€™s reliability (way beyond human).

To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades. 

Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.

GM & Toyota took everything that worked & moved it to their other factories.

We rewrote all labeling software for 4D. Very different from labeling single photos. Dojo wonâ€™t contribute for about a year. Itâ€™s mostly a generalized NN training computer, but benchmark weâ€™re tracking is frames/second. Must beat next gen GPU/TPU clusters or itâ€™s pointless.

Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles & 40 cycles is their max.

Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 & N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of todayâ€™s test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results.

Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but itâ€™s less than 1% of the pain.

Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do. 

What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.

The objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware. This is a much more serious issue:

Perhaps slightly more confident, but itâ€™s essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.

Strange, if true. 

- Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.

- A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?

T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.

He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.

An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto.

Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.

That data, like all data, is subject to latency & error. The system will evolve to that which minimizes both.

Thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present, hence hard touchdown. Weâ€™ve never seen this before.

Next time, min two engines all the way to the ground & restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues.

Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. 

Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.

There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. 

Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.

If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.

A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year.

Everyone has a take on @elonmusk. Mine is that he deserves a fair shake. No more, no less.

Wherever you see him on the hero-villain spectrum, I encourage you to read this and sit with the implications.

Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent & didnâ€™t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasnâ€™t needed. 

Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.

Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield & stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.

However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating & land intact.

Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal â€œglideâ€?with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs).

Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). 

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. 

As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.

Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month.

This is a â€œmarch of 9â€™sâ€?trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving.

Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesnâ€™t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.

Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.

Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full & can stabilize grid.

Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous & double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.

In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.

We had to focus on removing radar & confirming safety. That release goes out next week to US production. Then a week or two to polish pure vision FSD & v9 beta will release. Difference between v8 & v9 is gigantic.

I think weâ€™re maybe a month or two away from wide beta. But these things are hard to predict accurately. 

The work we had to do for pure vision driving was needed for FSD, so much more progress has been made than it would seem.

Bitcoin is actually highly centralized, with supermajority controlled by handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies.

Thatâ€™s where we get most of our lithium. Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range).

Iron cathode cells are now competitive for stationary packs & mid range cars.

Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. 

Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator.

Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration.

The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets! 

We have a few ideas for increasing torque & max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun & exciting engineering ahead!

This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.

When thereâ€™s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.

At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. Going public sooner than that would be very painful. Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference.

Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building & launching rocket of that size is >>4X. 

In retrospect, <9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass & ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V.

Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry >100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. 

Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload.

Also, accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer, so we need more close call examples.

For safety tests, Autopilot sees dummy far away. Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers.

Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. This is basically Raptor 2.

Raptor Vacuum would be only variant. Tbd as to whether to commonize R-Vac with Raptor 2 (more thrust), keep same or tighten throat (more Isp).

L/D makes quite a big difference. We do care about lift for Starship much more than Dragon, as lower peak heating is needed for reusability of heat shield.

Dragon prefers high peak, low total heat load, as it is driven by tile heat pulse reaching bondline while under parachutes.

More ground stations & less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.

Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond & satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping >20ms.

Not bad, although new Model S has more range & faster charging. 3 & Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed & handling, not max range. 

Supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kW to 300kW, so that will help too.

Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full â€œparking lotâ€? 

Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full.

To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. 

I donâ€™t care. I love it so much even if others donâ€™t. 

Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future.

Large pouch cells undergo significant volumetric changes at high state of charge.

Even so, fire risk is probably less than gasoline cars. There are over 200,000 combustion engine car fires every year in US alone. Itâ€™s literally in the name.

He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of todayâ€™s value.

Actually, I like & use Apple products. 

They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean 30% fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable. 

Epic wouldnâ€™t bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair.

Normally, competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees, but Apple & Android have a duopoly on phones. When interface familiarity is taken into account, itâ€™s basically a monopoly. 

The effective 30% sales tax Apple charges is hidden from users or there would be an outcry.

Thatâ€™s arguably a security issue, but  allowing companies to use other payment options, especially for in-app purchases would be fair.

As soon as they allowed that, they would have to lower their fees.

As for the cost of reviewing apps for security, a fixed fee makes sense.

Indeed. Grid fin designs clearly work, but do they maximize payload? Good chance that they do not. 

Something with much more drag to reduce terminal velocity & so reduce landing propellant might have better performance. Not sure.

Tesla Automation (Deutschland) built a specialized machine to wrap the rotor with carbon fiber at precise tension. 

If too low, it would come loose at low temp, due to CTE differences. If too high, it would snap at high temp & rpm.

Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isnâ€™t obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V.

There is a reason no fully reusable orbital rocket has been built â€?itâ€™s an insanely hard problem. 

Moreover, it must be rapidly & completely reusable (like an airplane). This is the only way to make life multiplanetary.

Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large.

16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.

Without flaps & heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs donâ€™t add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights.

However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 & has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.

Starship will be crushingly cost-effective for Earth orbit or moon missions as soon as itâ€™s operational & rapid reuse is happening. 

Mars is a lot harder, because Earth & Mars only align every 26 months, so ship reuse is limited to ~dozen times over 25 to 30 year life of ship.

Beta 10 or maybe 10.1. Going to pure vision set us back initially. Vision plus (coarse) radar had us trapped in a local maximum, like a level cap.

Pure vision requires fairly advanced real-world AI, but thatâ€™s how our whole road system is designed to work: NNâ€™s with vision.

Btw, thereâ€™s a slight error with forward flap design. Moving section is needed for control, but passive section is counter-productive, as it pushes nose backwards. 

New design rotates fwd flaps more to leeward & further forward to improve moment arm. Maybe ~120 deg apart.

Probably slightly further forward, smaller, more inward. No funny looking static aero at top, as static aero no longer directly in flow.

No, bottom static aero pushes engine section back, counteracting Starshipâ€™s low center of mass on reentry caused by the engine section. 

Aiming for 60 to 70 deg angle of attack during high heating portion of flight. Donâ€™t want to reenter with engines blasted by plasma.

We should be there with Beta 10, which goes out a week from Friday (no point release this week). 

It will have a completely retrained NN, so will need another few weeks after that for tuning & bug fixes. Best guess is public beta button in ~4 weeks.

Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel & iron.

Iâ€™d personally slightly opt for iron pack, as it wants to be charged to 100%, whereas nickel prefers ~90%.

2021 has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages, so it wouldnâ€™t matter if we had 17 new products, as none would ship. 

Assuming 2022 is not mega drama, new Roadster should ship in 2023.

I was in the Berlin paint shop talking to the team on my last visit. Itâ€™s gonna be great! 

But bear in mind that it takes about a year for a new factory to reach volume production. Production is super hard work, which is why I have great respect for those who do it.

Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints, so data can go from say Sydney to London through space, which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber & shorter path. 

Also, no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!

Yes. 

Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots.

Then, pressure & heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.

Pretty basic.

There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth, but much less nickel. 

For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron.

Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles & aircraft.

Large incumbent carmakers sell their cars at low to zero true margin. Most of their profit is selling replacement parts to their fleet, of which 70% to 80% are past warranty.

New car companies lack this advantage. Also lack sales & service infrastructure.

FSD 10 predicts height from video pixels directly, without needing to classify groups of pixels into objects.

Long chain hydrocarbons, like kerosene, have excellent volumetric energy density, but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen, which is CH4. 

Also, easy to make & store CH4+O2 from CO2+H2O, which are abundant on Mars.

This engine needs to be 10X lower cost. Order of magnitude change is good reason for a new name. 

What really matters is not yet another â€œadvancedâ€?rocket engine, as there are many such devices, but there has never been a cheap (<$1000/Ton-force) rocket engine. Not even close

Not recently. What matters imo is lowering fees, decreasing block time & increasing block size. A single layer network with exchanges as de facto layer 2 seems like the simplest solution for a medium of exchange.

Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble! Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD. 

Our internal QA fleet didnâ€™t see this, because cars are constantly in use, so very rarely enter power saving mode. Internal QA will obv test this case going forward.

Tentative plan is 98 & above starts uploading Friday afternoon next week.

If we see any concerns, uploads will pause while we investigate, so might take a few days before everyone with 98 safety gets beta 10.4.

10.4 improves left turns across fast traffic & stopping for gates.

US national debt is ~$28,900 billion or ~$229k per taxpayer.

Even taxing all â€œbillionairesâ€?at 100% would only make a small dent in that number, so obviously the rest must come from the general public. This is basic math.

Spending is the real problem.

GM & Chrysler were bailed out (money never repaid), but Tesla was not.

Crucial Tesla investment actually came from Daimler in 2009, from which they did very well.

Tesla received govt energy efficiency loan in 2010, by which time capital markets reopened. Loan was repaid early.

If any of this is based on Hertz, Iâ€™d like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.

Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers.

Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics.

Tragically, it is not clear that the defense contractors can get to the moon for any amount of money. 

More than $200B has been spent on development of new US crewed space transport systems over past ~40 years, but only Dragon is flying. Development cost to NASA was <$2B.

Last year, Japan had ~800k births & life expectancy is 85 years (impressively high!), implying future population of only 68M, dropping almost half from current population of 126M.

Thatâ€™s a lot of ghost towns & cities.

Big changes may impact output for a day or two. Reversing out big changes or unexpected parts shortages are what impact several days.

While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the â€œhard oneâ€? in fact they are all difficult & important. Tight C & custom compiler too.

An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency, reliability & long life is also critical. Canâ€™t just jam GPUs in the trunk.

Iâ€™m a fan of Rust. Clearly scales well, given that Discord uses it.

For max performance, however, nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware. Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer.

Otherwise, we mostly use C++ & Python.

However, the road system was designed to work with biological neural nets & eyes, so a general solution to self-driving necessarily will require silicon neural nets & cameras.
